## Purpose 
Here is where I am saving some outputs from exploratory (spatial) data analysis focused on this question: 

		> Is the urbanization process (size, local distribution, rate) and its effects 
		(water demand - broken by sector) responsible for causing the lacking 
		(access, quality, affordability, distributional losses) to service in the region 
		(controlling for physical assets / hydrological condition, population, etc.)?
